Ques3: What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples

Sol:
A loop allows you to execute a block of code multiple times. Loops are useful when you need to perform repetitive tasks, such as iterating over arrays, printing numbers, or performing calculations multiple times.

The primary purpose of loops is to automate repetitive actions in code, reducing the need to manually repeat code. They save time, prevent redundancy, and make code more efficient and readable.

Types of Loops in JavaScript:
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do...while loop


1. for loop:
The for loop is the most common type of loop, used when the number of iterations is known in advance. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}

Eg:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);  
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4


2. while loop:
The while loop runs as long as the specified condition is true. It is typically used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

syntax:
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}

Eg:
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4


3. do...while loop:
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but the code block is executed at least once, even if the condition is false initially

syntax:
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);

Eg:
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);  
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
// Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
