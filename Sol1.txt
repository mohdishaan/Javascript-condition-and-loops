Conditional Statements in javascript:

Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to perform different actions based on different conditions. They are used to control the flow of execution depending on whether a given condition evaluates to true or false.

Types of Conditional Statements:
1. if statement
2. if...else statement
3. else if statement
4. switch statement



1. if statement:
The if statement executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

syntax:
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}

Eg:
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}
//Output: You are eligible to vote



2. if...else statement:
The if...else statement executes one block of code if a condition is true and another block(else block) of code if the condition is false

syntax:
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}

Eg:
let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
    console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}
//Output: You are not eligible to vote



3. else if statement:
The else if statement is used to specify a new condition to test if the first condition is false

syntax:
if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if both conditions are false
}

Eg:
let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
    console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
    console.log("Grade: B");
} else {
    console.log("Grade: C");
}
//Output: Grade: B


4. switch statement:
The switch statement evaluates an expression and matches the expression's value against different cases. It executes the code for the matching case and can use a default case if no match is found. It also uses break statement after every case so that it terminates the flow of switch statement there only.

syntax:
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code to be executed if expression === value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code to be executed if expression === value2
        break;
    default:
        // Code to be executed if no cases match
}

Eg:
let day = 2;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        console.log("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        console.log("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Invalid day");
}
//Output: Tuesday
